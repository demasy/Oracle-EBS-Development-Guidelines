# Customization Standards Guidelines

- Eliminate Customization
- Customization By Extension
- Customization by Modification

<br>

## Eliminate Customization
Void Customization as you can; you can eliminate the need for customization by altering the application configuration (such as setting up a descriptive flexfield).

<br>

## Customization By Extension
It would be best if you customized by extension rather than by modification to void the risk of overwriting or losing your customization during an upgrade or patch.
