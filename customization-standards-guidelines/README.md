# Customization Standards Guidelines

- Eliminate Customization
- Customization By Extension
- Customization by Modification

<br>

## Eliminate Customization
Void customization as you can!; you can eliminate the need for customization by altering the application configuration (such as setting up a descriptive flexfield).

<br>

## Customization by Modification
-  When you cannot meet a requirement using Oracle Application features and customization by extension is not an option, you can use customization by modification.
-  You must copy the component to be modified into a custom application and follow the guidelines for customization by extension.
-  If you cannot define the modified component in a custom application, you should preserve a copy of the original.

> **Recommendation!**

## Customization By Extension
It would be best if you customized by extension rather than by modification to void the risk of overwriting or losing your customization during an upgrade or patch.
